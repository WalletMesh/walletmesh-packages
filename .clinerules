# Project Guidelines

## Repository Overview

### Standards

- Use pnpm for package management
- Use `changeset` for versioning and changelogs
- Use typescript for all code
- Use biome for linting and formatting. The `pnpm lint:fix` and `pnpm format:fix` will run biome and fix issues.
- Use vitest for testing

## Documentation Standards

- TSDoc standards should be used for documenting all code.
- The `docs/` directory in each package contains only autogenerated documentation.

# Code Quality Rules

## Testing

- Before attempting completion, ensure that any code changes have test coverage
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes

# Linting

- Prefer fixing underlying issues over disabling lint rules. Never disable any lint rules without explicit user approval.
- Document any approved lint rule disabling with a comment explaining the reason

# Project Guidelines

All project guidelines, standards, and conventions are documented in CLAUDE.md files:

- **Root CLAUDE.md**: Contains project-wide information, architecture overview, and general guidelines
- **Package-specific CLAUDE.md files**: Located in each package directory with detailed implementation information

Please refer to these CLAUDE.md files for:
- Repository structure and overview
- Development standards and tools
- Code style guidelines
- Git workflow and commit conventions
- Build, lint, and test commands
- Architecture details
- Security guidelines
- Troubleshooting tips

The CLAUDE.md files are the single source of truth for all project documentation and should be referenced when working with this codebase.

"@walletmesh/aztec-helpers": minor

This package has been updated to align with the `@aztec/aztec.js@0.87.8` release.

-   Refactored helper functions and tests to match the updated method signatures and object structures in the new Aztec version.
-   Corrected `FunctionType` import path to `@aztec/stdlib/abi`.
-   Ensured all tests pass against the latest Aztec dependencies.
